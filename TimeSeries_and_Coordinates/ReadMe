SCN Bioluminescence Dataset (SCN1-7) and FigS11-SCN1-3.
This directory contains the detrended time series data and spatial coordinates for SCN cells (SCN1–SCN7) and the three SCN shown in FigS11. 
The data is organized by individual Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN) samples and further divided by hemisphere.

Directory Structure
Data for each SCN is organized into subfolders by sample ID (e.g., SCN1/), with separate files for the Left and Right hemispheres

File Descriptions

1. DetrendedTraces.csv: This file contains the processed PER2::LUC bioluminescence time series sampled at 1-hour intervals.
	Columns: Each column represents an individual cell.
	Rows: Each row represents a single time point.
	Headers: The first row contains the unique Cell IDs.

2. Coordinates.csv: This file provides the spatial context for each cell recorded in the traces.
	Column 1 (x): The x-coordinate of the cell.
	Column 2 (y): The y-coordinate of the cell.
	Column 3 (CycID/Pixel): The unique identifier for the cell.
	Note: The CycID/Pixel in this file corresponds directly to the Cell IDs found in the top row of the DetrendedTraces.csv file.
